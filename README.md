# Object_Detection_Using_RaspberryPI
The Repository describes the implementation of real time object detection on Raspberry PI using tensorflow lite model
The project is divided in the following chapters,
<details>
  <summary>1. Prerequisites needed to implement the project</summary>
For this project, a Raspberry Pi board, an external monitor, a keyboard, and a mouse are required to interact with the board. Alternatively, the board can be accessed by connecting it directly to a laptop, but the method for accessing the board differs in this case. We will discuss that approach in another repository.

The Raspberry Pi board used in this project is the XXXXXXXXXXXX version. To connect the monitor, use an HDMI cable, and similarly, USB ports can be used to connect other peripherals such as the mouse, keyboard, and camera. Refer to the image provided to ensure the hardware connections are set up correctly.

  Once the imager is download, user need to have an SD card over which the ISO file i.e image file needs to be burned.

Select the operating system (OS) you wish to burn onto the SD card. For this project, I have used Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit), which is highly versatile and suitable for most applications. Please note that burning the OS onto the SD card will erase all existing data on it, so ensure you back up any important files beforehand.

Once the OS i.e ISO file is burned to the card, we will establish the hardware connection as discussed in the previous chapter. Once that is done we need to enable the camera settings and test whether the board is able to access the camera or not, for that we will click a picture, the same is demonstrated below.






After this we will install the Python and other required libraries, used in the project.
